<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THE CASKET.</p><p>Behind the house at the Rue Fossette there was a garden--large, considering that it lay in the heart of a city, and to my recollection at this day it seems pleasant: but time, like distance, lends to certain scenes an influence so softening; and where all is stone around, blank wall and hot pavement, how precious seems one shrub, how lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground!</p><p>There went a tradition that Madame Beck's house had in old days been a convent. That in years gone by--how long gone by I cannot tell, but I think some centuries--before the city had over-spread this quarter, and when it was tilled ground and avenue, and such deep and leafy seclusion as ought to embosom a religious house--that something had happened on this site which, rousing fear and inflicting horror, had left to the place the inheritance of a ghost-story.</p></div> </div>
