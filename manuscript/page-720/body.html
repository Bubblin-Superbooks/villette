<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>* * * * *</p><p>A fortnight passed; I was getting once more inured to the harness of school, and lapsing from the passionate pain of change to the palsy of custom. One afternoon, in crossing the carr√©, on my way to the first classe, where I was expected to assist at a lesson of "style and literature," I saw, standing by one of the long and large windows, Rosine, the portress. Her attitude, as usual, was quite nonchalante. She always "stood at ease;" one of her hands rested in her apron-pocket, the other at this moment held to her eyes a letter, whereof Mademoiselle coolly perused the address, and deliberately studied the seal.</p><p>A letter! The shape of a letter similar to that had haunted my brain in its very core for seven days past. I had dreamed of a letter last night.</p></div> </div>
