<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two minutes I stood over Madame, feeling that the whole woman was in my power, because in some moods, such as the present--in some stimulated states of perception, like that of this instant--her habitual disguise, her mask and her domino, were to me a mere network reticulated with holes; and I saw underneath a being heartless, self-indulgent, and ignoble. She quietly retreated from me: meek and self-possessed, though very uneasy, she said, "If I would not be persuaded to take rest, she must reluctantly leave me." Which she did incontinent, perhaps even more glad to get away, than I was to see her vanish.</p><p>This was the sole flash-eliciting, truth-extorting, rencontre which ever occurred between me and Madame Beck: this short night-scene was never repeated. It did not one whit change her manner to me. I do not know that she revenged it.</p></div> </div>
