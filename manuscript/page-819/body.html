What a conceited doll it is!"</p><p>Soured and listless, Miss Fanshawe was beginning to disclose the causes of her prostrate condition. There had been a retrenchment of incense, a diversion or a total withholding of homage and attention coquetry had failed of effect, vanity had undergone mortification. She lay fuming in the vapours.</p><p>"Is Miss de Bassompierre quite well now?" I asked.</p><p>"As well as you or I, no doubt; but she is an affected little thing, and gave herself invalid airs to attract medical notice.
