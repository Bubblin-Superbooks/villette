<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All falsities--all figments! We will not deal in this gear. Let us be honest, and cut, as heretofore, from the homely web of truth.</p><p>Homely, though, is an ill-chosen word. What I see is not precisely homely. A girl of Villette stands there--a girl fresh from her pensionnat. She is very comely, with the beauty indigenous to this country. She looks well-nourished, fair, and fat of flesh. Her cheeks are round, her eyes good; her hair is abundant. She is handsomely dressed. She is not alone; her escort consists of three persons--two being elderly; these she addresses as "Mon Oncle" and "Ma Tante." She laughs, she chats; good-humoured, buxom, and blooming, she looks, at all points, the bourgeoise belle.</p></div> </div>
