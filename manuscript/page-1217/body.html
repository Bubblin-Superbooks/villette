Emanuel, sad as Saul, and stern as Joab, and there triumphed his accusers.</p><p>At these two I looked. I was gathering my courage to tell them that I would neither write nor speak another word for their satisfaction, that their theme did not suit, nor their presence inspire me, and that, notwithstanding, whoever threw the shadow of a doubt on M. Emanuel's honour, outraged that truth of which they had announced themselves the--champions: I meant to utter all this, I say, when suddenly, a light darted on memory.</p></div> </div>
