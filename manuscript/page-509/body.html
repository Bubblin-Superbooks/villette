<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Reader; I felt alarmed! Why? you will ask. What was there in this simple and somewhat pretty sleeping-closet to startle the most timid? Merely this--These articles of furniture could not be real, solid arm-chairs, looking-glasses, and washstands--they must be the ghosts of such articles; or, if this were denied as too wild an hypothesis--and, confounded as I was, I did deny it--there remained but to conclude that I had myself passed into an abnormal state of mind; in short, that I was very ill and delirious: and even then, mine was the strangest figment with which delirium had ever harassed a victim.</p><p>I knew--I was obliged to know--the green chintz of that little chair; the little snug chair itself, the carved, shining-black, foliated frame of that glass; the smooth, milky-green of the china vessels on the stand;</p></div> </div>
