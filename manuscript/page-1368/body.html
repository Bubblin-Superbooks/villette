Utterly incapable of sleeping or lying still--excited from head to foot--what could I do better than dress?</p><p>The gates were locked, soldiers set before them: was there, then, no admission to the park?</p><p>The other day, in walking past, I had seen, without then attending to the circumstance, a gap in the paling--one stake broken down: I now saw this gap again in recollection--saw it very plainly--the narrow, irregular aperture visible between the stems of the lindens, planted orderly as a colonnade. A man could not have made his way through that aperture, nor could a stout woman, perhaps not Madame Beck; but I thought I might: I fancied I should like to try, and once within, at this hour the whole park would be mine--the moonlight, midnight park!</p></div> </div>
