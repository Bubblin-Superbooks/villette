To have my bit of comfort preternaturally snatched from me, ere I had well tasted its virtue!</p><p>I don't know what the others were doing; I could not watch them: they asked me questions I did not answer; they ransacked all corners; they prattled about this and that disarrangement of cloaks, a breach or crack in the sky-light--I know not what. "Something or somebody has been here," was sagely averred.</p><p>"Oh! they have taken my letter!" cried the grovelling, groping, monomaniac.</p><p>"What letter, Lucy? My dear girl, what letter?" asked a known voice in my ear. Could I believe that ear? No: and I looked up. Could I trust my eyes? Had I recognised the tone? Did I now look on the face of the writer of that very letter? Was this gentleman near me in this dim garret, John Graham--Dr. Bretton himself?</p></div> </div>
