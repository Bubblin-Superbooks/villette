<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Most true was it.</p><p>On bringing me my tea next morning Goton urged me to call in a doctor. I would not: I thought no doctor could cure me.</p><p>One evening--and I was not delirious: I was in my sane mind, I got up--I dressed myself, weak and shaking. The solitude and the stillness of the long dormitory could not be borne any longer; the ghastly white beds were turning into spectres--the coronal of each became a death's-head, huge and sun-bleached--dead dreams of an elder world and mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping eyeholes. That evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the conviction that Fate was of stone, and Hope a false idol--blind, bloodless, and of granite core. I felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining its climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble, trembling as they were.</p></div> </div>
