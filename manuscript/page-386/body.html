The choice, too, of the actors required knowledge and care; then came lessons in elocution, in attitude, and then the fatigue of countless rehearsals. For all this, as may well be supposed, St. Pierre did not suffice: other management, other accomplishments than hers were requisite here. They were supplied in the person of a master--M. Paul Emanuel, professor of literature. It was never my lot to be present at the histrionic lessons of M.</p></div> </div>
