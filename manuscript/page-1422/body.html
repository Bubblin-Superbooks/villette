<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I turned from the group of trees and the "merrie companie" in its shade. Midnight was long past; the concert was over, the crowds were thinning. I followed the ebb. Leaving the radiant park and well-lit Haute-Ville (still well lit, this it seems was to be a "nuit blanche" in Villette), I sought the dim lower quarter.</p><p>Dim I should not say, for the beauty of moonlight--forgotten in the park--here once more flowed in upon perception. High she rode, and calm and stainlessly she shone. The music and the mirth of the fÃªte, the fire and bright hues of those lamps had out-done and out-shone her for an hour, but now, again, her glory and her silence triumphed. The rival lamps were dying: she held her course like a white fate. Drum, trumpet, bugle, had uttered their clangour, and were forgotten; with pencil-ray she wrote on heaven and on earth records for archives everlasting.</p></div> </div>
