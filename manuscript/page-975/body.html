Dites donc, mon ami."</p><p>"Monsieur Paul, je vous pardonne."</p><p>"I will have no monsieur: speak the other word, or I shall not believe you sincere: another effort--mon ami, or else in English,--my friend!"</p><p>Now, "my friend" had rather another sound and significancy than "mon ami;" it did not breathe the same sense of domestic and intimate affection; "mon ami" I could not say to M. Paul; "my friend," I could, and did say without difficulty. This distinction existed not for him, however, and he was quite satisfied with the English phrase. He smiled. You should have seen him smile, reader; and you should have marked the difference between his countenance now, and that he wore half an hour ago. I cannot affirm that I had ever witnessed the smile of pleasure, or content, or kindness round M. Paul's lips, or in his eyes before.</p></div> </div>
