Chance apprised me of their return very shortly after it took place.</p><p>I was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard, wandering slowly on, enjoying the benign April sun, and some thoughts not unpleasing, when I saw before me a group of riders, stopping as if they had just encountered, and exchanging greetings in the midst of the broad, smooth, linden-bordered path; on one side a middle-aged gentleman and young lady, on the other--a young and handsome man. Very graceful was the lady's mien, choice her appointments, delicate and stately her whole aspect.</p></div> </div>
