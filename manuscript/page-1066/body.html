Alas! I had no such appetite. What I loved, it joyed me by any effort to content; but the noble hunger for science in the abstract--the godlike thirst after discovery--these feelings were known to me but by briefest flashes.</p><p>Yet, when M.

Whatever my powers--feminine or the contrary--God had given them, and I felt resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of his bestowal.</p></div> </div>
