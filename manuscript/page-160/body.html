Oh, the number of foreign schools I have been at in my life! And yet I am quite an ignoramus. I know nothing--nothing in the world--I assure you; except that I play and dance beautifully,--and French and German of course I know, to speak; but I can't read or write them very well. Do you know they wanted me to translate a page of an easy German book into English the other day, and I couldn't do it. Papa was so mortified: he says it looks as if M. de Bassompierre--my godpapa, who pays all my school-bills--had thrown away all his money. And then, in matters of information--in history, geography, arithmetic, and so on, I am quite a baby; and I write English so badly--such spelling and grammar, they tell me.</p></div> </div>
