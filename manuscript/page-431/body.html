<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That whole evening was Madame on duty beside these "jeunes gens"--attentive to them as a mother, but strict with them as a dragon. There was a sort of cordon stretched before them, which they wearied her with prayers to be permitted to pass, and just to revive themselves by one dance with that "belle blonde," or that "jolie brune," or "cette jeune fille magnifique aux cheveux noirs comme le jais."</p><p>"Taisez-vous!" Madame would reply, heroically and inexorably. "Vous ne passerez pas Ã  moins que ce ne soit sur mon cadavre, et vous ne danserez qu'avec la nonnette du jardin" (alluding to the legend). And she majestically walked to and fro along their disconsolate and impatient line, like a little Bonaparte in a mouse-coloured silk gown.</p></div> </div>
