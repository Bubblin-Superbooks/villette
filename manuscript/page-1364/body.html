<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But what bodily illness was ever like this pain? This certainty that he was gone without a farewell--this cruel conviction that fate and pursuing furies--a woman's envy and a priest's bigotry--would suffer me to see him no more? What wonder that the second evening found me like the first--untamed, tortured, again pacing a solitary room in an unalterable passion of silent desolation?</p><p>Madame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that night--she did not come near me: she sent Ginevra Fanshawe--a more efficient agent for the purpose she could not have employed. Ginevra's first words--"Is your headache very bad to-night?" (for Ginevra, like the rest, thought I had a headache--an intolerable headache which made me frightfully white in the face, and insanely restless in the foot)--her first words, I say, inspired the impulse to flee anywhere, so that it were only out of reach. And soon, what followed--plaints about her own headaches--completed the business.</p></div> </div>
