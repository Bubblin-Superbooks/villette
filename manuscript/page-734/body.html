<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For some reason--gladdened, I think, by a sudden return of the golden glimmer of childhood, roused by an unwonted renewal of its buoyancy, made merry by the liberty of the closing hour, and, above all, solaced at heart by the joyous consciousness of that treasure in the case, box, drawer up-stairs,--I fell to playing with the handkerchief as if it were a ball, casting it into the air and catching it--as it fell. The game was stopped by another hand than mine--a hand emerging from a palet√¥t-sleeve and stretched over my shoulder; it caught the extemporised plaything and bore it away with these sullen words:</p><p>"Je vois bien que vous vous moquez de moi et de mes effets."</p></div> </div>
