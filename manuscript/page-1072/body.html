Again he quoted I know not what authors and passages, and while rolling out their sweet and sounding lines (the classic tones fell musically from his lips--for he had a good voice--remarkable for compass, modulation, and matchless expression), he would fix on me a vigilant, piercing, and often malicious eye.
