I felt from the first it was me he wanted--me he was seeking--and had not I wanted him too? What, then, had carried me away? What had rapt me beyond his reach?

Yearning to listen and console, while I thought audience and solace beyond hope's reach--no sooner did opportunity suddenly and fully arrive, than I evaded it as I would have evaded the levelled shaft of mortality.</p><p>Well, my insane inconsistency had its reward. Instead of the comfort, the certain satisfaction, I might have won--could I but have put choking panic down, and stood firm two minutes--here was dead blank, dark doubt, and drear suspense.</p></div> </div>
