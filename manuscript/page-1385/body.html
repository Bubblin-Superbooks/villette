Right before me sat the Brettons and de Bassompierres. Within reach of my hand--had I chosen to extend it--sat a figure like a fairy-queen, whose array, lilies and their leaves seemed to have suggested; whatever was not spotless white, being forest-green. My godmother, too, sat so near, that, had I leaned forward, my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her bonnet. They were too near; having been just recognised by a comparative stranger, I felt uneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance.</p><p>It made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton, turning to Mr. Home, and speaking out of a kind impulse of memory, said,--"I wonder what my steady little Lucy would say to all this if she were here? I wish we had brought her, she would have enjoyed it much."</p></div> </div>
