<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I liked to watch every action of my godmother; all her movements were so young: she must have been now above fifty, yet neither her sinews nor her spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age. Though portly, she was alert, and though serene, she was at times impetuous--good health and an excellent temperament kept her green as in her spring.</p><p>While she read, I perceived she listened--listened for her son. She was not the woman ever to confess herself uneasy, but there was yet no lull in the weather, and if Graham were out in that hoarse wind--roaring still unsatisfied--I well knew his mother's heart would be out with him.</p></div> </div>
