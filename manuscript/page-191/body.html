<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>No inn was this. A brass-plate embellished the great porte-coch√®re: "Pensionnat de Demoiselles" was the inscription; and beneath, a name, "Madame Beck."</p><p>I started. About a hundred thoughts volleyed through my mind in a moment. Yet I planned nothing, and considered nothing: I had not time. Providence said, "Stop here; this is your inn." Fate took me in her strong hand; mastered my will; directed my actions: I rang the door-bell.</p><p>While I waited, I would not reflect. I fixedly looked at the street-stones, where the door-lamp shone, and counted them and noted their shapes, and the glitter of wet on their angles. I rang again. They opened at last. A bonne in a smart cap stood before me.</p></div> </div>
