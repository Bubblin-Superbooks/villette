Mrs. Bretton was not generally a caressing woman: even with her deeply-cherished son, her manner was rarely sentimental, often the reverse; but when the small stranger smiled at her, she kissed it, asking, "What is my little one's name?"</p><p>"Missy."</p><p>"But besides Missy?"</p><p>"Polly, papa calls her."</p><p>"Will Polly be content to live with me?"</p><p>"Not always; but till papa comes home. Papa is gone away." She shook her head expressively.</p></div> </div>
