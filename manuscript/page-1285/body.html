How beautiful she grew in her happiness, I can hardly express, but I wondered to see her. As to that gentle ice of hers--that reserve on which she had depended; where was it now? Ah! Graham would not long bear it; he brought with him a generous influence that soon thawed the timid, self-imposed restriction.</p></div> </div>
