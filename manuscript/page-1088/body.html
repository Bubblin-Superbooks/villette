<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My principal attraction towards this group of guests lay, I remember, in one figure--that of a handsome young girl whom I had seen before as a visitor at Madame Beck's, and of whom I had been vaguely told that she was a "filleule," or god-daughter, of M. Emanuel's, and that between her mother, or aunt, or some other female relation of hers, and the Professor, had existed of old a special friendship. M. Paul was not of the holiday band to-day, but I had seen this young girl with him ere now, and as far as distant observation could enable me to judge, she seemed to enjoy him with the frank ease of a ward with an indulgent guardian. I had seen her run up to him, put her arm through his, and hang upon him. Once, when she did so, a curious sensation had struck through me--a disagreeable anticipatory sensation--one of the family of presentiments, I suppose--but I refused to analyze or dwell upon it.</p></div> </div>
