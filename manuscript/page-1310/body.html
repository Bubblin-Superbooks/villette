I love you, papa; but I love Graham too--because--because--it is impossible to help it."</p><p>"This splendid Graham is a young scamp, Polly--that is my present notion of him: it will surprise you to hear that, for my part, I do not love him one whit. Ah! years ago I saw something in that lad's eye I never quite fathomed--something his mother has not--a depth which warned a man not to wade into that stream too far; now, suddenly, I find myself taken over the crown of the head."</p></div> </div>
