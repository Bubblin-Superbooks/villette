I never asked to be made learned, and you compel me to feel very profoundly that learning is not happiness."</p><p>And returning to my desk, I laid my head on my arms, nor would I speak to him for two days afterwards. He pained and chagrined me. His affection had been very sweet and dear--a pleasure new and incomparable: now that this seemed withdrawn, I cared not for his lessons.</p><p>The books, however, were not taken away; they were all restored with careful hand to their places, and he came as usual to teach me. He made his peace somehow--too readily, perhaps: I ought to have stood out longer, but when he looked kind and good, and held out his hand with amity, memory refused to reproduce with due force his oppressive moments. And then, reconcilement is always sweet!</p></div> </div>
