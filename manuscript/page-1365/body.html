<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I went up-stairs. Presently I was in my bed--my miserable bed--haunted with quick scorpions. I had not been laid down five minutes, when another emissary arrived: Goton came, bringing me something to drink. I was consumed with thirst--I drank eagerly; the beverage was sweet, but I tasted a drug.</p><p>"Madame says it will make you sleep, chou-chou," said Goton, as she received back the emptied cup.</p><p>Ah! the sedative had been administered. In fact, they had given me a strong opiate. I was to be held quiet for one night.</p><p>The household came to bed, the night-light was lit, the dormitory hushed. Sleep soon reigned: over those pillows, sleep won an easy supremacy: contented sovereign over heads and hearts which did not ache--he passed by the unquiet.</p></div> </div>
