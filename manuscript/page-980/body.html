<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THE WATCHGUARD.</p><p>M. Paul Emanuel owned an acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of interruption, from whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: to pass through the classe under such circumstances was considered by the teachers and pupils of the school, individually and collectively, to be as much as a woman's or girl's life was worth.</p><p>Madame Beck herself, if forced to the enterprise, would "skurry" through, retrenching her skirts, and carefully coasting the formidable estrade, like a ship dreading breakers. As to Rosine, the portress--on whom, every half-hour, devolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out of the very heart of one or other of the divisions to take their music-lessons in the oratory, the great or little saloon, the salle-Ã -manger, or some other piano-station--she would, upon her second or third attempt, frequently become almost tongue-tied from excess of consternation--a sentiment inspired by the unspeakable looks levelled at her through a pair of dart-dealing spectacles.</p></div> </div>
