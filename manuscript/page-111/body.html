<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two hot, close rooms thus became my world; and a crippled old woman, my mistress, my friend, my all. Her service was my duty--her pain, my suffering--her relief, my hope--her anger, my punishment--her regard, my reward. I forgot that there were fields, woods, rivers, seas, an ever-changing sky outside the steam-dimmed lattice of this sick chamber; I was almost content to forget it. All within me became narrowed to my lot. Tame and still by habit, disciplined by destiny, I demanded no walks in the fresh air; my appetite needed no more than the tiny messes served for the invalid. In addition, she gave me the originality of her character to study: the steadiness of her virtues, I will add, the power of her passions, to admire; the truth of her feelings to trust. All these things she had, and for these things I clung to her.</p></div> </div>
