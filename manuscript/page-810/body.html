<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Poor wretch! He does his best to bear up, but he is a poor, pallid, wasting wretch, despite that best.</p><p>Towards the last of these long seven weeks I admitted, what through the other six I had jealously excluded--the conviction that these blanks were inevitable: the result of circumstances, the fiat of fate, a part of my life's lot and--above all--a matter about whose origin no question must ever be asked, for whose painful sequence no murmur ever uttered. Of course I did not blame myself for suffering: I thank God I had a truer sense of justice than to fall into any imbecile extravagance of self-accusation; and as to blaming others for silence, in my reason I well knew them blameless, and in my heart acknowledged them so: but it was a rough and heavy road to travel, and I longed for better days.</p></div> </div>
