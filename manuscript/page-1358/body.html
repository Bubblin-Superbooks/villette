Make your own bed warm and soft; take sedatives and meats, and drinks spiced and sweet, as much as you will. If you have any sorrow or disappointment--and, perhaps, you have--nay, I know you have--seek your own palliatives, in your own chosen resources. Leave me, however. Leave me, I say!"</p><p>"I must send another to watch you, Meess: I must send Goton."</p><p>"I forbid it. Let me alone. Keep your hand off me, and my life, and my troubles. Oh, Madame! in your hand there is both chill and poison. You envenom and you paralyze."</p></div> </div>
