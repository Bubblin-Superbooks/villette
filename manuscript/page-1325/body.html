She was become a bond to both, an influence over each, a mutual concord. From them she drew her happiness, and what she borrowed, she, with interest, gave back.</p><p>"Is there, indeed, such happiness on earth?" I asked, as I watched the father, the daughter, the future husband, now united--all blessed and blessing.</p><p>Yes; it is so. Without any colouring of romance, or any exaggeration of fancy, it is so. Some real lives do--for some certain days or years--actually anticipate the happiness of Heaven; and, I believe, if such perfect happiness is once felt by good people (to the wicked it never comes), its sweet effect is never wholly lost. Whatever trials follow, whatever pains of sickness or shades of death, the glory precedent still shines through, cheering the keen anguish, and tinging the deep cloud.</p></div> </div>
