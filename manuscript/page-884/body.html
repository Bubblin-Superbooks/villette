And, papa, mind to come soon, for I shall watch and listen."</p><p>The door closed, and the carriage rolled softly through the snow; and back returned the Countess, pensive and anxious.</p><p>She did listen, and watch, when evening closed; but it was in stillest sort: walking the drawing-room with quite noiseless step. She checked at intervals her velvet march; inclined her ear, and consulted the night sounds: I should rather say, the night silence; for now, at last, the wind was fallen. The sky, relieved of its avalanche, lay naked and pale: through the barren boughs of the avenue we could see it well, and note also the polar splendour of the new-year moon--an orb white as a world of ice. Nor was it late when we saw also the return of the carriage.</p></div> </div>
