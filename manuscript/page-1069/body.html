<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On a certain morning a message came from my godmother, inviting me to attend some notable lecture to be delivered in the same public rooms before described. Dr. John had brought the message himself, and delivered it verbally to Rosine, who had not scrupled to follow the steps of M.

Quels yeux--quel regard! Tenez! J'en ai le coeur tout ému!"</p><p>When she was gone, my professor demanded of me why I suffered "cette fille effrontée, cette créature sans pudeur," to address me in such terms.</p></div> </div>
