It was a polite Frenchman, M. Z----, a very learned, but quite a courtly man, who had drawn her into discourse. I was charmed with her French; it was faultless--the structure correct, the idioms true, the accent pure; Ginevra, who had lived half her life on the Continent, could do nothing like it not that words ever failed Miss Fanshawe, but real accuracy and purity she neither possessed, nor in any number of years would acquire. Here, too, M. de Bassompierre was gratified; for, on the point of language, he was critical.</p></div> </div>
