<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Good-night, Dr. John; you are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine. Good-night, and God bless you!"</p><p>Thus I closed my musings. "Good-night" left my lips in sound; I heard the words spoken, and then I heard an echo--quite close.</p><p>"Good-night, Mademoiselle; or, rather, good-evening--the sun is scarce set; I hope you slept well?"</p><p>I started, but was only discomposed a moment; I knew the voice and speaker.</p><p>"Slept, Monsieur! When? where?"</p><p>"You may well inquire when--where. It seems you turn day into night, and choose a desk for a pillow; rather hard lodging--?"</p></div> </div>
