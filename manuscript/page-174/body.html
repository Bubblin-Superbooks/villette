I asked.</p><p>"Gif!" said he impatiently; and as he half-snatched them from my hand, he added, "All right! haf your tronc soon."</p><p>Fortunately it did turn out all right: he was from the custom-house. Where to go to get some breakfast I could not tell; but I proceeded, not without hesitation, to descend.</p></div> </div>
