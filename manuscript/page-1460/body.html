<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ere long I sat beside him once more myself--re-assured, not desperate, nor yet desolate; not friendless, not hopeless, not sick of life, and seeking death.</p><p>"It made you very sad then to lose your friend?" said he.</p><p>"It kills me to be forgotten, Monsieur," I said. "All these weary days I have not heard from you one word, and I was crushed with the possibility, growing to certainty, that you would depart without saying farewell!"</p><p>"Must I tell you what I told Modeste Beck--that you do not know me? Must I show and teach you my character? You will have proof that I can be a firm friend? Without clear proof this hand will not lie still in mine, it will not trust my shoulder as a safe stay? Good. The proof is ready. I come to justify myself."</p></div> </div>
