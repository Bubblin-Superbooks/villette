<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>pieuse," drawled by a sleepy pupil, some tragedy made grand by grand reading, ardent by fiery action--some drama, whereof, for my part, I rarely studied the intrinsic merit; for M.

Or else he would flash through our conventual darkness a reflex of a brighter world, show us a glimpse of the current literature of the day, read us passages from some enchanting tale, or the last witty feuilleton which had awakened laughter in the saloons of Paris; taking care always to expunge, with the severest hand, whether from tragedy, melodrama, tale, or essay, whatever passage, phrase, or word, could be deemed unsuited to an audience of "jeunes filles." I noticed more than once, that where retrenchment without substitute would have left unmeaning vacancy, or introduced weakness, he could, and did, improvise whole paragraphs, no less vigorous than irreproachable; the dialogue--the description--he engrafted was often far better than that he pruned away.</p></div> </div>
