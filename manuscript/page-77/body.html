It was her ambition to be permitted to have a ride round the courtyard on this pony; but far be it from her to ask such a favour. One day she descended to the yard to watch him dismount; as she leaned against the gate, the longing wish for the indulgence of a ride glittered in her eye.</p><p>"Come, Polly, will you have a canter?" asked Graham, half carelessly.</p><p>I suppose she thought he was too careless.</p><p>"No, thank you," said she, turning away with the utmost coolness.</p></div> </div>
