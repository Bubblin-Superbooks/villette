Near me as he now sat, strongly and closely as he had long twined his life in mine--far as had progressed, and near as was achieved our minds' and affections' assimilation--the very suggestion of interference, of heart-separation, could be heard only with a fermenting excitement, an impetuous throe, a disdainful resolve, an ire, a resistance of which no human eye or cheek could hide the flame, nor any truth-accustomed human tongue curb the cry.</p></div> </div>
