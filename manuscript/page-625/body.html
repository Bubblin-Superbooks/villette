"You must have a new one."</p><p>She went out. She returned presently with a dressmaker. She had me measured. "I mean," said she, "to follow my own taste, and to have my own way in this little matter."</p><p>Two days after came home--a pink dress!</p><p>"That is not for me," I said, hurriedly, feeling that I would almost as soon clothe myself in the costume of a Chinese lady of rank.</p></div> </div>
