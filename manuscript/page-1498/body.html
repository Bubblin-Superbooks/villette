There is enough said. Trouble no quiet, kind heart; leave sunny imaginations hope. Let it be theirs to conceive the delight of joy born again fresh out of great terror, the rapture of rescue from peril, the wondrous reprieve from dread, the fruition of return. Let them picture union and a happy succeeding life.</p><p>Madame Beck prospered all the days of her life; so did PÃ¨re Silas; Madame Walravens fulfilled her ninetieth year before she died.
