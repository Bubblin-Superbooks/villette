I like Polly: I like all her ways and all her looks--but then I am her father; and even I never thought about beauty. She is amusing, fairy-like, interesting to me;--you must be mistaken in supposing her handsome?"</p><p>"She attracts, sir: she would attract without the advantages of your wealth and position."</p><p>"My wealth and position! Are these any bait to Graham? If I thought so----"</p><p>"Dr. Bretton knows these points perfectly, as you may be sure, M. de Bassompierre, and values them as any gentleman would--as you would yourself, under the same circumstances--but they are not his baits. He loves your daughter very much; he feels her finest qualities, and they influence him worthily."</p></div> </div>
