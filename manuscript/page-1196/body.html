Nor have I for a day lost sight of you, nor for an hour failed to take in you a rooted interest. Passed under the discipline of Rome, moulded by her high training, inoculated with her salutary doctrines, inspired by the zeal she alone gives--I realize what then might be your spiritual rank, your practical value; and I envy Heresy her prey."</p></div> </div>
