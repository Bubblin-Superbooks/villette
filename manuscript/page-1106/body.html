<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not only did I watch you; but often--especially at eventide--another guardian angel was noiselessly hovering near: night after night my cousin Beck has stolen down yonder steps, and glidingly pursued your movements when you did not see her."</p><p>"But, Monsieur, you could not from the distance of that window see what passed in this garden at night?"</p><p>"By moonlight I possibly might with a glass--I use a glass--but the garden itself is open to me. In the shed, at the bottom, there is a door leading into a court, which communicates with the college; of that door I possess the key, and thus come and go at pleasure. This afternoon I came through it, and found you asleep in classe; again this evening I have availed myself of the same entrance."</p></div> </div>
