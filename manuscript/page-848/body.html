How often, while women and girls sit warm at snug fire-sides, their hearts and imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding their persons, forced out by night to wander through dark ways, to dare stress of weather, to contend with the snow-blast, to wait at lonely gates and stiles in wildest storms, watching and listening to see and hear the father, the son, the husband coming home.</p><p>Father and son came at last to the ch√¢teau: for the Count de Bassompierre that night accompanied Dr. Bretton.</p></div> </div>
