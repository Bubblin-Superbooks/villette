<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The sun passes the equinox; the days shorten, the leaves grow sere; but--he is coming.</p><p>Frosts appear at night; November has sent his fogs in advance; the wind takes its autumn moan; but--he is coming.</p><p>The skies hang full and dark--a wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast themselves into strange forms--arches and broad radiations; there rise resplendent mornings--glorious, royal, purple as monarch in his state; the heavens are one flame; so wild are they, they rival battle at its thickest--so bloody, they shame Victory in her pride. I know some signs of the sky; I have noted them ever since childhood. God watch that sail! Oh! guard it!</p></div> </div>
