They say that hundreds of years ago a nun was buried here alive at the foot of this very tree, beneath the ground which now bears us."</p><p>"And that in former days a nun's ghost used to come and go here."</p><p>"Monsieur, what if it comes and goes here still?"</p><p>"Something comes and goes here: there is a shape frequenting this house by night, different to any forms that show themselves by day. I have indisputably seen a something, more than once; and to me its conventual weeds were a strange sight, saying more than they can do to any other living being. A nun!"</p></div> </div>
