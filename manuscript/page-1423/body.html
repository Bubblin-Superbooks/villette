The night-sky lit her reign: like its slow-wheeling progress, advanced her victory--that onward movement which has been, and is, and will be from eternity to eternity.</p><p>These oil-twinkling streets are very still: I like them for their lowliness and peace. Homeward-bound burghers pass me now and then, but these companies are pedestrians, make little noise, and are soon gone. So well do I love Villette under her present aspect, not willingly would I re-enter under a roof, but that I am bent on pursuing my strange adventure to a successful close, and quietly regaining my bed in the great dormitory, before Madame Beck comes home.</p></div> </div>
